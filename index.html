			<td><p>Dungeons and Dragons was first published in 1974 by TSR as a slightly modified version of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"><b>Chainmail</b></a> which was also designed in part by Gary Gygax. Chainmail was a miniatures wargame in which players controlled a military formation, and could engage in tactical combat on a model battlefield. D&D changed the game by allowing players to control a single characer, with which they could go on an adventure. There have been several editions of D&D since 1974, all of which added upon and improved the rules. There was a split in the game from 1977 to 2000, as '77 saw the release of both Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) and the D&D Basic Set. The Basic set was created while AD&D was still in the works as a way to indroduce new players to D&D, which, despite a growing fanbase, was still lrgely unknown. The hope was that players would finish the levels one through three that were offered in the simpler Basic Set and move on to rules-heavy AD&D. This was unsuccesful, as the Basic set underwent multiple revisions, each making it more a of a standalone game under the same banner, rather than a stepping stone to AD&D.</p></td>

			<td><p>AD&D was also revised, but unlike the five revisions that Basic went through, this only happened once to AD&D. It's second edition was released in 1987, compiling the rules, and adding some simplifications. It also removed some thngs that had gained a negative response from critics, specifically the inclusion of demons and devils as monsters, as well as the character class Assassin and the half-orc playable race.</p</td>
