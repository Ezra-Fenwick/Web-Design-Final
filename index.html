			<td><p>Dungeons and Dragons was first published in 1974 by TSR as a slightly modified version of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"><b>Chainmail</b></a> which was also designed in part by Gary Gygax. Chainmail was a miniatures wargame in which players controlled a military formation, and could engage in tactical combat on a model battlefield. D&D changed the game by allowing players to control a single characer, with which they could go on an adventure. There have been several editions of D&D since 1974, all of which added upon and improved the rules. There was a split in the game from 1977 to 2000, as '77 saw the release of both Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) and the D&D Basic Set. The Basic set was created while AD&D was still in the works as a way to indroduce new players to D&D, which, despite a growing fanbase, was still lrgely unknown. The hope was that players would finish the levels one through three that were offefer in the Basic Set and move on to AD&D. This was unsuccesful, as the Basic set underwent multiple revisions, making it more a of a standalone game under the same banner, rather than a stepping stone to AD&D.</p></td>
