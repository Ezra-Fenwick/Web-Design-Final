			<td><p>Dungeons and Dragons was first published in 1974 by TSR as a slightly modified version of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"><b>Chainmail</b></a> which was also designed in part by Gary Gygax. Chainmail was a miniatures wargame in which players controlled a military formation, and could engage in tactical combat on a model battlefield. D&D changed the game by allowing players to control a single characer, with which they could go on an adventure. There have been several editions of D&D since 1974, all of which added upon and improved the rules. There was a split in the game from 1977 to 2000, as '77 saw the release of both Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) and the D&D Basic Set. The Basic set was created while AD&D was still in the works as a way to indroduce new players to D&D, which, despite a growing fanbase, was still lrgely unknown. The hope was that players would finish the levels one through three that were offered in the simpler Basic Set and move on to rules-heavy AD&D. This was unsuccesful, as the Basic set underwent multiple revisions, each making it more a of a standalone game under the same banner, rather than a stepping stone to AD&D.</p></td>

			<td><p>AD&D was also revised, but unlike the five revisions that Basic went through, this only happened once to AD&D. It's second edition was released in 1987, compiling the rules, and adding some simplifications. It also removed some thngs that had gained a negative response from critics, specifically the inclusion of demons and devils as monsters, as well as the character class Assassin and the half-orc playable race. The combat and character cretion processes were also modified, allowing for more intuitive combat and faster character creation. The 2nd edition of AD&D was re-released in 1995, with all-new art, and formatting. Later that year, a set of three "Player's Option" books, which detailed alternative rules and character options, as well as a "Dungeon Master's Option" book for high-level campigning. </p</td>

			<td><p>The third edition was released in the year 2000, consolidating the game into one edition. NUmerous rule changes are implemented with the aim of simplifying play. The game now uses a standard system of rolling a twenty-sided die to resolve nearly all actions, and most of the player's option combat rules have been adopted, along with primarily grid-bsed combat. Restrictions on what class any given player race can do are lifted, and the games major systems are published under the Open game Licensce (OGL), which allows for the use and modification of the rules without requiring the direct approval of the publisher. 3.5 is published in 2003 as a minor update to rule. The game remained largely unchanged. The Fourth edition was published in 2007, with a major changes to the games systems. The fourth edition shifted combat into a highly tactical, grid-based method of play, and simplified much of the game rules. A new addition to the "core set" was added each year, until 2010. There was severe backlash over this edition, with many hating the simplifications to rules, and removal of player options. The negative response likely contributed to the speedy announcement of a fifth edition in 2012.</p></td>

		<tr>
			<td>The Fifth edition was developed with a large amount of player feedback, by way of public playtesting sessions. The final edition of its rules were released in 2014, with the three core books releasing from August to December of that year. The rules read mostly as a reworked version of prior editions, with the exception of the fourth. However, it does still attempt to streamline play, and to bring the game back to using the core stats. This is the current edition of D&D.</td>
